ü§î Assumptions and Decisions

The project uses the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch blog data.

Infinite scroll is implemented for better user experience.

The bell counter is incremented on each blog card click to simulate notifications.

Reviews and the newsletter subscription section are static and not tied to the API.
